# java-fundamentals
Part 1 of Java Course

For running this course you will need:
- An Java compatible IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ or VSCode- if you are comfortable with using only TextPad or some other tool that's ok by me ;)
- Java SE (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

# Java Fundamentals
## Part 1 of Java Course

For running this course you will need:
- [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

- An Java compatible IDE, here are some suggestions:
  - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) - this will be the official IDE used in this course
  - [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - you will need to install Java support
  - If you are comfortable using only TextPad or some other tool, that's ok by me ;)

- Classes, objects, attributes, methods, arrays, and lists (maybe other collections as well)
